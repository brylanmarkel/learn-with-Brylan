# What is superintelligence?
Simply put, it's an intelligence that is significantly smarter than humans. Scientists developing the technology believe it will be capable of solving problems we can't solve alone, and can create technologies that are more effective and efficient than what we currently have.

In a world where superintelligence exists, it's not hard to imagine a world where everyone is happily enjoying their lives and we've cured major diseases -- a utopia of sorts. However, this optimism isn't without awareness of the potential risks the technology creates.

This is why it's important we ask ourselves, how should we govern superintelligence?
