# About these notes
Hey! Iâ€™m Brylan Donaldson, and it looks like you're here to peek inside my brain. These notes are my personal musings on everything from business to life, where I document my insights, ideas, and inspirations. Iâ€™ve decided to share them as an experiment and see what kind of conversations it might stimulate. Just keep in mind that these notes are for me, so they may seem a bit confusing or under-explained. But maybe thatâ€™s what makes them so interesting to read? 

Ready to give it a try and see what you can learn?

For now, thereâ€™s no index or navigational aids: youâ€™ll need to follow a link to some starting point. You might be interested in Â§Whatâ€™s top of mind.
