# About these notes
Hey! Iâ€™m Brylan Donaldson, and it looks like you're here to peek inside my brain. Below you'll find my personal musings on everything from business to life, where I document my insights, ideas, and inspirations. Iâ€™ve decided to share them as an experiment and see what new ideas it might stimulate. Just keep in mind that these musings are for me, so they may seem a bit confusing or under-explained. But maybe thatâ€™s what makes them so interesting to ponder over?
