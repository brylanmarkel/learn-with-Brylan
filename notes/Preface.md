# About these notes
Hi! Iâ€™m Brylan Donaldson. Youâ€™ve stumbled upon my working notes. Theyâ€™re kind of strange, so some context might help.

These notes are mostly written for myself: theyâ€™re roughly my thinking environment (Evergreen notes; My morning writing practice). But Iâ€™m sharing them publicly as an experiment (Work with the garage door up). If a note seems confusing or under-explained, itâ€™s probably because I didnâ€™t write it for you! Sorryâ€”thatâ€™s sort of an essential tension of this experiment (Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience).

For now, thereâ€™s no index or navigational aids: youâ€™ll need to follow a link to some starting point. You might be interested in Â§Whatâ€™s top of mind.
